           Hi, my name is Jeffrey Cheng. I am a rising sophomore at Princeton University, where I am studying
           computer science. I am from Bridgewater, New Jersey, where I have grown up my whole life. Thus, 
           I am a New Jersey resident through and through, although I do make visits to Taiwan when possible.
           <br>
           Outside of academics, I spend much of my time playing ultimate frisbee for my school's team. I 
           also enjoy playing piano and viola, and I have recently started picking up the Chinese yo-yo again.
           During my free time, I like watching the NBA.
